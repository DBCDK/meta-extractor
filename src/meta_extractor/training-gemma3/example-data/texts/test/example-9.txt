   Executive Overview synthetic timetable simulations demonstrate recurring misalignments between modeled rail-to-bus
    connection windows   particularly at fictional transfer hubs with inconsistent dwell buffering\n

Baseline Coordination synthetic network runs show fluctuating throughput on core corridors
     with uneven propagation of delay artifacts when branching services intersect during peak cycles

Alignment Models proposed synthetic harmonization framework tests staggered departure clusters, rotational timing offsets,
and adaptive slack redistribution protocols\nSection 3 Scenario Outcomes modeled results indicate smoother interchange
 continuity and reduced rider wait variance when applying multi-region synchronisation loops

 Implementation Notes recommendations emphasize iterative schedule recalibration
  dynamic dispatch override thresholds   and distributed monitoring agents to trace micro-delay behavior
